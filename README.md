## 💡 Tips 💡

</div>

### 🌟 Maximizing Timetable Quality

- **Complete Faculty Profiles**: Enter detailed faculty availability patterns including preferred teaching hours and specialized skills
- **Constraint Prioritization**: Define a clear hierarchy of constraints (hard vs. soft) to guide the optimization engine
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use the analytics dashboard after each generation to identify and address specific bottlenecks
- **Strategic Room Allocation**: Group similar subjects in nearby rooms to minimize transit time for both students and faculty
- **Balanced Workload**: Distribute teaching hours evenly throughout the week to prevent faculty fatigue

### 🔥 Power User Techniques

- **Template Creation**: Save successful timetable configurations as templates for future terms
- **Custom Optimization Rules**: Define institution-specific rules to address unique scheduling requirements
- **Batch Processing**: Generate multiple timetable variants simultaneously to compare different approaches
- **Constraint Relaxation**: Temporarily relax non-critical constraints to find innovative scheduling solutions
- **Incremental Scheduling**: For complex institutions, schedule departments sequentially in order of constraint complexity
